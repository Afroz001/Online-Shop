Created an API with GET, POST, DELETE, PATCH requests to track id, name, price, quantity, description and link for each data stored in Mongo Atlas Cloud DB.  Using Postman to test API requests from localhost, Node.js to create server routes for orders and products and NPM packages (the following definitions below are provided from 'https://www.npmjs.com/'):


Nodemon - "nodemon will watch the files in the directory in which nodemon was started, and if any files change, nodemon will automatically restart your node application."

Body-Parser - "Parse incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, available under the req.body property."

Morgan - "HTTP request logger middleware for node.js."

Express - Node web framework used for APIs and server connections.

Mongoose - "Mongoose provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data. It includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks and more, out of the box (courtesy of http://mongoosejs.com/)."
